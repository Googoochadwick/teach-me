C++ Compiler Error Reference (Beginner–Intermediate)

General Rules:
- Most C++ statements must end with a semicolon (;).
- Many compiler errors are reported on the line *after* the real mistake.
- One syntax error can cause many follow-up errors.
- Fix the first error before fixing others.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: expected ';'
Meaning:
- The compiler expected a semicolon but did not find one.

Common Causes:
- Missing semicolon at the end of a statement.
- Missing semicolon after a class or struct definition.
- Missing closing brace '}' before the error line.

How to Fix:
- Check the line above the reported error.
- Add a semicolon at the end of the statement.
- Ensure braces are properly closed.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: control reaches end of non-void function
Meaning:
- A function that must return a value does not return one on all paths.

Common Causes:
- Missing return statement.
- Conditional branches that do not all return a value.

How to Fix:
- Ensure every possible path returns a value.
- Add a return statement at the end of the function.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: no matching function for call to
Meaning:
- A function was called with arguments that do not match any defined version.

Common Causes:
- Wrong number of arguments.
- Incorrect argument types.
- Function declared but not defined.

How to Fix:
- Check the function signature.
- Ensure argument types and count match.
- Verify the function is declared correctly.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: invalid conversion from 'type1' to 'type2'
Meaning:
- The code attempts to convert between incompatible types.

Common Causes:
- Assigning incompatible variable types.
- Passing wrong argument types to a function.

How to Fix:
- Change the variable type.
- Use an explicit cast if the conversion is valid.
- Check function parameter types.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: expected '}' at end of input
Meaning:
- The compiler reached the end of the file but expected a closing brace.

Common Causes:
- Missing closing brace '}'.
- Unmatched opening brace '{'.

How to Fix:
- Count opening and closing braces.
- Ensure each '{' has a matching '}'.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: undeclared identifier / was not declared in this scope
Meaning:
- The variable or function name is unknown at that point in the code.

Common Causes:
- Misspelled variable or function name.
- Variable used before declaration.
- Missing include or namespace.

How to Fix:
- Check spelling.
- Declare the variable before use.
- Add the correct header or namespace.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: expected primary-expression
Meaning:
- The compiler expected a valid expression but found invalid syntax.

Common Causes:
- Extra or missing operators.
- Empty parentheses.
- Incorrect use of keywords.

How to Fix:
- Check the syntax around the error.
- Ensure expressions are complete and valid.

--------------------------------------------------

Notes for Students:
- Compiler error messages describe *what the compiler expected*, not always *what is wrong*.
- The real mistake is often on the line before the reported error.
- Fix errors from top to bottom.
