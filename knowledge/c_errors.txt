C Compiler Error Reference (Beginner–Intermediate)

General Rules:
- Most C statements must end with a semicolon (;).
- The C compiler often reports errors on the line after the real mistake.
- One syntax error can cause many follow-up errors.
- Always fix the first reported error before others.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: expected ';'
Meaning:
- The compiler expected a semicolon but did not find one.

Common Causes:
- Missing semicolon at the end of a statement.
- Missing semicolon after a struct definition.
- Missing closing brace '}' before the error line.

How to Fix:
- Check the line above the reported error.
- Add a semicolon at the end of the statement.
- Ensure braces are properly closed.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: expected '}' at end of input
Meaning:
- The compiler reached the end of the file but expected a closing brace.

Common Causes:
- Missing closing brace '}'.
- Unmatched opening brace '{'.

How to Fix:
- Count opening and closing braces.
- Ensure each '{' has a matching '}'.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: implicit declaration of function
Meaning:
- A function is used without being declared first.
- In modern C standards (C99 and later), this is an error.

Common Causes:
- Missing function prototype.
- Missing header file.

How to Fix:
- Declare the function before use.
- Include the correct header file.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: incompatible types when assigning
Meaning:
- A value is assigned to a variable of an incompatible type.

Common Causes:
- Assigning a pointer to a non-pointer variable.
- Assigning different numeric types without casting.

How to Fix:
- Ensure both sides of the assignment have compatible types.
- Use explicit casts only when safe.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: invalid operands to binary operator
Meaning:
- An operator was used with operands of incompatible types.

Common Causes:
- Using arithmetic operators on pointers.
- Mixing incompatible types in expressions.

How to Fix:
- Check the types of both operands.
- Use the correct operator for the data types.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
Meaning:
- The left side of an assignment must be a modifiable variable.

Common Causes:
- Assigning to a constant.
- Assigning to an expression or function call.

How to Fix:
- Assign only to variables.
- Remove assignments to non-modifiable expressions.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: array subscript is not an integer
Meaning:
- An array index is not of an integer type.

Common Causes:
- Using a pointer or float as an array index.

How to Fix:
- Use an integer type as the array index.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: too few arguments to function
Meaning:
- A function call does not provide enough arguments.

Common Causes:
- Missing parameters in the function call.
- Incorrect function prototype.

How to Fix:
- Pass all required arguments.
- Verify the function declaration.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: too many arguments to function
Meaning:
- A function call provides more arguments than expected.

Common Causes:
- Incorrect function prototype.
- Calling the wrong function.

How to Fix:
- Match the function call to the declared signature.

--------------------------------------------------

Error: segmentation fault (runtime error)
Meaning:
- The program accessed invalid memory at runtime.

Common Causes:
- Dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- Accessing memory out of bounds.
- Using uninitialized pointers.

How to Fix:
- Initialize pointers before use.
- Check array bounds.
- Validate pointer values before dereferencing.

--------------------------------------------------

Notes for Students:
- C does not perform automatic bounds checking.
- Many runtime errors are not detected at compile time.
- Compiler warnings are important and should not be ignored.
